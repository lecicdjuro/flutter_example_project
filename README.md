# flutter_example_app

A new Flutter Google Translate example application

## Getting Started

In this project is created a translation
app using the Google Translation API and native Material UI design components in Flutter.
The translation app allows you to select the source and output language (source will also allow auto-detect option) and will fetch the results from the Google API using the API key. Once the result is shown, users can set the phrase as favorite, which will be listed in the second section of the app - the search favorite history. Favorites are stored locally on the device and persistent even if the app is restarted.
